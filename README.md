# MichelleGreen_final_test_p2
Michelle Green, This is the Version control for the final test
Michelle Green: here are the instructions for the final test repository 
This is my reflection: As we near the the end of this coarse, I have become much more familiar with Git hub, making me feel more confident moving forward with creating my own personal projects and adding them to my Git Hub. I have also become more confidnet using git command in conjunction with github. I hope to continue to master Git Hub.
Thank you for a wonderful semester!
